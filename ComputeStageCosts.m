%COMPUTESTAGECOSTS Compute stage costs.
% 	Compute the stage costs for all states in the state space for all
%   attainable control inputs.
%
%   G = ComputeStageCosts(stateSpace, controlSpace, disturbanceSpace,
%   mazeSize, walls, targetCell) computes the stage costs for all states in
%   the state space for all attainable control inputs.
%
%   Input arguments:
%
%       stateSpace:
%           A (MN x 2) matrix, where the i-th row represents the i-th
%           element of the state space. Note that the state space also
%           contains the target cell, in order to simplify state indexing.
%
%       controlSpace:
%           A (L x 2) matrix, where the l-th row represents the l-th
%           element of the control space.
%
%       mazeSize:
%           A (1 x 2) matrix containing the width and the height of the
%           maze in number of cells.
%
%   	walls:
%          	A (2K x 2) matrix containing the K wall segments, where the start
%        	and end point of the k-th segment are stored in row 2k-1
%         	and 2k, respectively.
%
%    	targetCell:
%          	A (2 x 1) matrix describing the position of the target cell in
%         	the maze.
%       holes:
%         	A (H x 2) matrix containg the H holes of the maze. Each row
%         	represents the position of a hole.
%
%   	resetCell:
%         	A (1 x 2) matrix describing the position of the reset cell in
%           the maze.
%
%       p_f:
%           The probability of falling into a hole when the ball is
%           traversing through or to a cell with a hole
%       
%       c_p:
%           Every time the ball bounces into a wall or boundary, we get this number 
%            of time steps as penalty.
%       c_r:
%           Every time the ball falls into a hole, the ball is set to the reset cell
%           at the beginning of the next stage and we get this number of time steps
%           as additional penalty.
%
%   Output arguments:
%
%       G:
%           A (MN x L) matrix containing the stage costs of all states in
%           the state space for all attainable control inputs. The entry
%           G(i, l) represents the cost if we are in state i and apply
%           control input l.
